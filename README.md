Easy Services – Business Funding Platform 💼⚡
A fast, user-friendly business funding platform I built for a U.S. client using Next.js.

With Easy Services, users can apply for merchant cash advances ranging from $5,000 to $500,000 — and potentially receive funds in as little as 24 hours, all without any collateral required.
